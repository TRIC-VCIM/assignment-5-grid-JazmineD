        <p> When Dean was four years old and Sam only six months old, their mother (Mary) was killed and their father (John) was   determined to find and kill the demon who killed his wife, thus raising the boys as hunters of all things evil. Their motto: "Saving people, hunting things; The family business". After John's death the boys continue the family business with the help of a few other hunters, traveling cross country, killing as many monsters as possible and saving as many people as they can. And at the same time they learn that "Family don't end with blood". They will do whatever it takes to save each other and their family. Going up against demons, vampires, werewolves, shapeshifters, demigods, witches, the four horsemen and even angels among other things. They lose family and find new people they call family. They have gone to heaven and hell for each other and will do it all over again. Cause that's what <em>family</em> does and <em>"Family don't end with blood".</em> </p>

        <p> There's been ups and downs throughout all the seasons but it always comes back to the brothers Sam and Dean kicking ass and winning against the evil foe. I have enjoyed this show since it came out on September 13th, 2005 when I was 14 years old. I have seen every single episode at least once. I re watch my favorites all the time.This show has lasted for 15 seasons for a reason The amazing cast and crew put their hearts and soul into, they made the characters come to life. The show didn't just create a fandom it created a family. Long after this show is over we will still be watching reruns and saying the lines along with them. #SPNfamily </p>

          <p> Even as of writing this review the fifteenth season isn't yet over, I have thoroughly enjoyed this show. I will miss  it, though I do think that if it went on for longer, it would get stale, and I wouldn't want that for a show that has been incredible as this one. This show has everything one could ask for: horror, science-fiction, fantasy, mystery, comedy, drama, and incredible characters matched with an incredible cast. The relationships of the characters, especially the brothers, are the core of the show, and help it keep itself together. This is the absolute binge-worthy show to watch alone, with friends, family, or whomever. It has a dedicated fandom, an amazing cast in both talent and personality, and enough emotion to pull on your heartstrings right after you watch monsters explode. This show does have good messages: you choose your own destiny, family doesn't end in blood, the importance of family, love, the list goes on. Don't let the length of the show fool you; it's a fun ride, and I will never regret watching it. </p>

         <p> This is hands down the BEST show I have ever seen! If you are considering watching it, please do- it is so so worth it!   The plot/storyline is absolutely incredible throughout the entire series, but just wait until you get to season 4 where the series’ overarching plot really starts to unfold! Don’t let the length of the show put you off- every single episode is a masterpiece and I have not once been bored. There are crazy clever mind-blowing moments and plot twists throughout. It’s definitely binge-worthy!  The show is great in every way, with horror, comedy, family, friendship, drama, mystery and more. The relationships between the characters, especially the brothers, are the heart of the show. The acting, cast and the characters they portray are just incredible (& loveable)!! The character development is super! The show has amazing but emotional dramas and conflicts, which can be painful & heartbreaking- but don’t worry, because it’s perfectly balanced with the fun & creative comedy and humour.  The show’s themes involve overcoming evil/fighting for what’s right, the meaning/purpose of life, the importance and meaning of family, love, choosing your own destiny/free will, and more. It’s relatable and has a whole lot of important/relevant messages.  I can’t wait to see the end of season 15 when it comes out- the season finals are always astonishing, let alone the series final!! But at the   same time I’m so sad that it’s going to be over! I can only hope that if you are reading this, you decide to join the family and watch the amazing show that is Supernatural. You’re in for a ride! </p>
